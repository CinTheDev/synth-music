# TODOs

All TODOs of this project are written here when needed; after completion the
relevant points will be removed again. Though, through versioning (git) it's
possible to still read finished (and therefore deleted) points.

## Missing features for composing

There are some missing features that are crucial for composing music.

### Seperation of measures

Measures are kind of invisible/non-existant in code right now. This isn't the
end of the world, the code works perfectly fine without it. Though when it comes
to workflow, it's a bit unusual to have no measures.

Think about a workflow feature to visibly seperate notes out into measures.

### Crescendo and decrescendo

A (de)crescendo represents a transition of the intensity. Since a (de)crescendo
should be able to change the intensity while a note plays, it needs to be
represented individually.

Implement it and restructure if needed.

## Add Drumset to melody example

Time to make use of everything being generic: Add a Drumset to the "melody"
example which plays tetris.

- Implement simplified "note" system with drum actions
- Implement drumset itself (probably with white noise)
- Write simple track for drumset

## Chunked rendering

Currently the exporter renders the whole music piece into one buffer which then
is written to the disk. The memory consumption might not be that big of a deal
(@ 44100Hz the buffer would take around 10MB for every minute of music), but
there are is another reason to make the rendering chunked.

Rendering can take a bit because it's currently single threaded. Chunked
rendering allows for Multi-Threaded rendering of the file, which will speed up
the rendering process by quite a bit. Also, the reduced memory consumption is
also not bad.
